## Brief Summary
The value anomaly refers to the historical outperformance of stocks deemed cheap by various financial multiples. A commonly used metric for value is price to book which we examine here. Price to book was used to create the initial "High Minus Low" Fama French Factor. We subtract the returns of low book to price firms from the returns of high book to price firms in order to get the difference in returns and plot the cumulative sum of the returns in order to see the comparative performance. Data is from the open Kenneth French Data Library.
